3D Interactive Analysis Stress Viewer

I am sharing the 3D Analysis Stress Viewer I developed to easily explore and visualize analysis results from any CSV file containing X, Y, Z, and stress (e.g., Von Mises) values.

I am not an expert analyst, just a mechanical designer. I only perform simple, amateur static analyses when needed for my own work.

Initially, I started this project because I needed a CSV file with X, Y, Z, and stress values for a certain analysis, but I couldn’t find a working Python script for it. Existing scripts I found didn’t work correctly.

Now, the viewer can load any CSV file with X, Y, Z, and stress values and display an interactive 3D visualization. (I also have a script to extract data from specific analysis outputs, but it will be shared separately after testing.)
